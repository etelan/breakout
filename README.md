# breakout
GOAL
Create a game similar to the classic arcade game Breakout.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING THIS PROJECT
Create a game similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)
● Your game should have a single screen with 8 rows of bricks, a paddle, and a ball.
● If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, you lose a ‘life’.
● After 5 lives, the game is over.
● Every time the ball touches a brick, the brick disappears and the score increases.
● The ball bounces off the paddle, the bricks, and the top, left and right edges of the
screen.
You can watch a video of the game being played here.
You may implement this in PyGame, or using any other technologies of your choice.
