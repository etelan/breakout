INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING THIS PROJECT
Create a game similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)

● Your game should have a single screen with 8 rows of bricks, a paddle, and a ball.

● If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, you lose a ‘life’.

● After 5 lives, the game is over.

● Every time the ball touches a brick, the brick disappears and the score increases.

● The ball bounces off the paddle, the bricks, and the top, left and right edges of the
screen.

You may implement this in PyGame, or using any other technologies of your choice.
